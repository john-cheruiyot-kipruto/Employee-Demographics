## Day 1 - SQL Learning Select and Where

SELECT: Instructs the system to extract and display specific columns from a targeted table.
WHERE: Restricts the output to only include records that satisfy a designated condition or set of criteria.
AND: A logical operator used for compounding requirements. Data is only returned if all specified conditions are simultaneously met.
OR / NOT OR: Data is returned if at least one of the multiple conditions is true.
NOT: It filters out any records that match the specified criteria, reporting only the remaining data.
